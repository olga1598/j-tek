                        The presentation of information on this website, or contact with the firm or any of its attorneys on an unsolicited basis, does not establish any form of attorney-client relationship with our firm or with Jeffrey Tekanic. An attorney-client relationship with the firm or Jeffrey Tekanic will only be established after the firm decides that it is willing and able to accept the engagement and the firm and the client enter into a written engagement letter. This website is not an offer to represent you. You should not provide any proprietary, confidential or privileged information to J-TEK LAW PLLC on an unsolicited basis, as unsolicited information will not be treated as confidential. Furthermore, sending an e-mail to J-TEK LAW PLLC also will not be considered as creating an attorney-client relationship or a request to take action with respect to the information unless an attorney-client relationship has already been established. Any request to take action, such as filing a patent application with a patent office, can only be made by an existing client of the firm.
